(5, 6, 'Bitches Brew', 8, 2, 1970, 'Paint ', 'Bitches Brew is a studio double album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released on March 30, 1970, on Columbia Records. The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed In a Silent Way album. With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style. Upon release, it received a mixed response, due to the album\'s unconventional style and experimental sound, but became Davis\'s first gold record;[6] it sold more than half a million copies.'),

It was intended to form part of a split release with English crossover thrash band Atavistic on Manic Ears (Bristol, England). After an extensive line-up change, the second half of Scum was recorded in May 1987 at Rich Bitch studio. The two sides were combined and released as a single album. Only drummer Mick Harris played on both sides of the album.[1]\r\n\r\nThe first pressing of the CD (1988) came as a 54-track CD, which included the From Enslavement to Obliteration album and four bonus tracks. In 1994, the first two albums were re-released separately. A remastered version was released on 27 January 2012. The album cover was designed by Bill Steer\'s Carcass bandmate Jeffrey Walker.

(13, 14, 'Licensed to Ill', 14, 6, 1986, 'Paint, Graphic Illustration  ', 'The cover for the Beastie Boys’ debut album, License To Ill, perfectly encapsulated the group’s subversive M.O. It showed a sleek plane with the Beasties’ logo on the tail–a nod to Led Zeppelin’s preferred mode of travel during the heyday of rockstar excess in the early ’70s–but only after opening the gatefold did you see the punchline: the plane had just smashed into a cliff.\r\n“That was our kind of sense of humor,” explains David Gamble, AKA World B. Omes, who painted the iconic cover in 1986. Gamble’s just one of many artists and designers interviewed in this month’s Juxtapoz, a special issue dedicated to all the compelling art that helped propel the trio’s career.

(14, 15, 'Cause for Alarm ', 17, 16, 1986, 'Graphic Illustration ', 'Agnostic Front’s Cause for Alarm is an atypical Hall of Fame induction. Most of the previous 100-plus albums that have graced these pages were created by bands that had a solid core and had been playing together (if not recording together) for years. Cause for Alarm was the second album from a band in transition at the time. Two of the five members who played on it weren’t on the band’s 1984 debut, Victim in Pain, and this is, in fact, the only Agnostic Front album they ever played on. Further adding to the intrigue is the involvement of Peter Steele (R.I.P.), who was fronting Carnivore at the time, but also had a hand in helping to create this album.\r\nDespite the less than solid lineup and other circumstances surrounding the making of the record, the quintet responsible for Cause—vocalist Roger Miret, guitarists Vinnie Stigma and Alex Kinon, bassist Rob Kabula and drummer Louie Beato—stepped up and made a crossover album that would piss off skinheads with its thrash-influenced music, outrage P.C. talk show hosts with its controversial lyrics and win over a rabid metal contingent with its streetwise hardcore intensity. This is an album that predates the Cro-Mags’ The Age of Quarrel by about four months, and it presaged a significant shift in one of the country’s most entrenched punk scenes.\r\n~Decibal '),
(15, 16, 'Ramones ', 20, 7, 1976, 'Photography, B&W Film', 'Ramones is the debut studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, released on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records. After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.\r\n\r\nThe album cover, photographed by Punk magazine\'s Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album\'s liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain. \r\n~ Wikipedia '),

(17, 18, 'Swordfishtrombones', 21, 2, 1983, 'Colored Tin Type, Photography ', 'Swordfishtrombones is an album by American singer-songwriter Tom Waits, released in September 1983. It was the first album that Waits produced himself. Stylistically different from his previous LPs, the album moves away from the piano and string orchestra arrangements of the late 1970s, replacing them instead with unusual instrumentation and a somewhat more abstract songwriting approach.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe cover art is a TinTone photograph by Michael A. Russ showing Waits with the actors Angelo Rossitto and Lee Kolima.\r\n\r\nThe album peaked at #164 on the Billboard Pop Albums and 200 albums charts. In 1989, Spin named Swordfishtrombones the second greatest album of all time. In 2006, Q placed the album at #36 in its list of \"40 Best Albums of the \'80s.\" Pitchfork listed Swordfishtrombones as 11th best album of the 1980s. Slant Magazine listed the album at #26 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980\'s\". ~Wikipedia'),
(18, 12, 'The Rise of the Serpent Men ', 22, 17, 1989, 'Graphic Illustration ', 'The lyrical theme of Rise of the Serpent Men is mainly anti-war, anti-religious and the environment. No surprises there, but they are very well written and like most crust and metal bands they use metaphors and go a lot deeper than standard black and white punk lyrics. Lyrically, my favorite on this album would have to be Life Chain. I view Life Chain with two different meanings. One interpretation is saying that people are strong enough to break away from the chains of religion they just need to realize it. Religion constantly tells people that they are weak, they’re sinners and that they need a magical being to get them through life. Axegrinder believes that that is bullshit and that people need to take control. The other interpretation is that people work themselves to death. Human beings are never satisfied so we work until we die so that we can accumulate more stuff. We create our own slavery with our greed.\r\n\r\nAxegrinder managed to release one of the greatest crust albums in their short existence and earn themselves a spot at the top of the heap. If you dig Amebix, Deviated Instinct, or Hellbastard you’ll love the even more metallic sounding Rise of the Serpent Men. ~Metal Archive'),
(19, 19, 'Bone Machine', 21, 14, 1992, 'Photography', 'Bone Machine is an album by Tom Waits, released in 1992 on Island Records. It won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and features guest appearances by Los Lobos\' David Hidalgo, Primus\' Les Claypool and Brain, and The Rolling Stones\' Keith Richards.\r\n\r\nBone Machine marked a return to studio material for Waits, coming a full five years after his previous studio album, Franks Wild Years (1987). The album is often noted for its dark lyrical themes of death and murder, and for its rough, stripped-down, percussion-heavy blues rock style.\r\n\r\nBone Machine was included on many Best Albums of the 1990s lists, including Pitchfork where it was number 49, and Rolling Stone where it was number 53.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cover photo, which consists of a blurred black-and-white, close-up image of Waits in a leather skullcap with horns and protective goggles, was taken by Jesse Dylan, the son of Bob Dylan.

Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974. After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman\'s departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (1967–1982), Ian McLagan (1978–1981), Billy Preston (through the mid-1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982–present). The band was first led by Brian Jones, but after developing into the band\'s songwriters, Jagger and Richards assumed leadership while Jones dealt with legal and personal troubles.', 1962),

(9, 'Led Zeppelin', 'Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band\'s heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music.', 1969),
(10, 'Funkadelic ', 'Funkadelic is an American band that was most prominent during the 1970s. The band and its sister act Parliament, both led by George Clinton, pioneered the funk music culture of that decade.\r\nThe group that would become Funkadelic was originally formed by George Clinton in 1964, as the unnamed musical backing for his doo wop group The Parliaments while on tour. The band originally consisted of musicians Frankie Boyce, Richard Boyce, and Langston Booth plus the five members of the Parliaments on vocals. Boyce, Boyce, and Booth enlisted in the Army in 1966, and Clinton recruited bassist Billy Bass Nelson and guitarist Eddie Hazel in 1967, then also added guitarist Tawl Ross and drummer Tiki Fulwood. The band name \"Funkadelic\" was coined by Nelson after the band relocated to Detroit. By 1968, because of a dispute with Revilot, the record company that owned the name \"The Parliaments,\" the ensemble began playing under the name Funkadelic.', 1970),

He is widely considered one of the most influential popular musicians of the 20th century and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide.Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\r\n\r\nCash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice,the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, which is characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms; a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black.\" He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I\'m Johnny Cash,\"followed by his signature song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".', 1957),

Eazy-E died in March 1995 after a brief battle with AIDS.\r\n\r\nEazy\'s main influences included 1970s funk groups, contemporary rappers, and comedians. When reviewing Eazy\'s albums, many critics noted his unique overall style, with Steve Huey of the All Music Guide remarking: \"While his technical skills as a rapper were never the greatest, his distinctive delivery... over-the-top lyrics, and undeniable charisma made him a star.\"~ Wikipedia', 1988),

Along with punk rock, the Clash also have played music genres such as post-punk, experimental rock, and new wave and their music often also incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, ska and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky \"Topper\" Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones\' departure the following year.

Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone.

Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.\r\n\r\nBorn in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Waymon aspired to be a concert pianist.[1] With the help of a few supporters in her hometown of Tryon, North Carolina, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York.[2]\r\n\r\nWaymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well-received audition.[3] Waymon became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to racial discrimination. Years later, two days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed on her an honorary degree.[3]\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Eunice Waymon changed her name to \"Nina Simone\". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil\'s music\"[3] or \"cocktail piano\" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.[4]\r\n\r\nSimone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974. She had a hit in the United States in 1958 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\".[1]\r\n\r\nSimone\'s musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach,[5] and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.[6][7] In 2018, Simone will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[8 ~Wikipedia', 1958),
(16, 'Napalm Death ', 'Napalm Death are a British extreme metal band formed in Meriden, West Midlands, England, in 1981.[1] While none of its original members remain in the group since December 1986, the lineup of vocalist Mark \"Barney\" Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent of the band\'s career since 1992\'s Utopia Banished, although, from 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added Jesse Pintado as the replacement of one-time guitarist Bill Steer; following Pintado\'s departure, the band reverted to a four-piece rather than replace him.\r\n\r\nNapalm Death are credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of crust punk and death metal, using a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdrive bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of incomprehensible growls, or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, fast tempos, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band\'s debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community.[2] According to the Guinness World Records, their song \"You Suffer\" is the shortest song in the world, at only 1.316 seconds long.\r\n\r\nNapalm Death have released fifteen studio albums and are listed by Nielsen SoundScan as the seventh best-selling death metal band in the United States.[3] ~Wikipedia ', 1981),

(18, 'Black Flag ', 'Black Flag are an American punk rock band formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California. Initially called Panic, the band was established by Greg Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band.

After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013.[1]\r\n\r\nBlack Flag\'s sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and, in later years, frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and nonconformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band\'s material was released on Ginn\'s independent record label SST Records.', 1981),
(19, 'Butthole Surfers ', 'Butthole Surfers is an American rock band formed by singer Gibby Haynes and guitarist Paul Leary in San Antonio, Texas in 1981.

Teresa Nervosa served as second drummer from 1983 to 1985, 1986 to 1989, and 2009. The band has also employed a variety of bass players, most notably Jeff Pinkus.[1][2]\r\n\r\nRooted in the 1980s hardcore punk scene, Butthole Surfers quickly became known for their chaotic and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, as well as their use of sound manipulation and tape editing.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were respected by their peers and attracted a devoted fanbase, Butthole Surfers had little commercial success until 1996\'s Electriclarryland. The album contained the hit single \"Pepper\" which climbed to number one on Billboard\'s Modern Rock Tracks chart that year. ~Wikipedia ', 1984),
(20, 'The Ramones ', 'The Ramones were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974.

They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years.[2] In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded.[3] By 2014, all four of the band\'s original members, lead singer Joey Ramone (1951–2001), bass guitarist Dee Dee Ramone (1951–2002), guitarist Johnny Ramone (1948–2004) and drummer Tommy Ramone (1949–2014), had died.[4][5][6][7]\r\n\r\nRecognition of the band\'s importance built over the years, and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as number 26 in the Rolling Stone magazine list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"[8] and number 17 in VH1\'s \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".[9] In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only the Beatles.[10] On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommy\'s replacement on drums, Marky Ramone, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[2][11] In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.', 1976),
(21, 'Tom Waits ', 'Thomas Alan Waits (born December 7, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, composer and actor. His distinctive voice was described by critic Daniel Durchholz as sounding as though \"it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car\".[1] Waits has built up a distinctive musical persona with his trademark growl, his incorporation of pre-rock music styles such as blues,[2][3][4] jazz, and vaudeville, and experimental tendencies verging on industrial music.[5]\r\n\r\nBorn to a middle-class Euro-American family, Waits was raised in Whittier, California, and then San Diego.

(1, 'Blues Rock ', 'Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock: electric guitar, electric bass, and drums, often with Hammond organ. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way it inspired and influenced hard rock, Southern rock, and early heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence in the 2010s, with performances and recordings by popular artists.'),
(2, 'Jazz', 'Jazz is a music genre that originated in African-American communities of New Orleans, United States,[1] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime.[2] Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation.[3] Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.[4] Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \"one of America\'s original art forms\".'),
(3, 'Hard Rock ', 'Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with keyboards.'),
(4, 'Funk', 'Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid-1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Like much of African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves. Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.'),
(5, 'Southern Gothic ', 'Southern Gothic (also known as Gothic Americana, or Dark Country) is a genre of music characterized by a fusion of alternative rock and classic country/folk. The genre shares thematic connections with the Southern Gothic genre of literature, and indeed the parameters of what makes something Gothic Americana appears to have more in common with literary genres than traditional musical ones. Songs often examine poverty, criminal behavior, religious imagery, death, ghosts, family, lost love, alcohol, murder, the devil and betrayal.'),
(6, 'Hip Hop', 'Hip hop or hip-hop is a subculture and art movement developed in The Bronx in New York City during the late 1970s.The origins of the word are often disputed. Some believe that the word was invented by Keith Cowboy of The Furious Five. Others believe it was a derogatory name for the people who practise the art and wear the relative clothing. It is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the South or West Bronx.[1][2][3][4][5] While the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music (also called rap),[6] hip hop is characterized by nine elements, however only four elements are considered most necessary to understand hip-hop musically. The main elements of hip-hop consist of four main pillars. The 5th element is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion or beatboxing however it is often debated.[2][7]\r\n\r\nAfrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: \"rapping\" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art.[7][2][8][9][10] Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others.[11][12][13]\r\n\r\nThe Bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Ghetto Brothers, a Puerto Rican group that has been described as being a gang, a club, and a music group. Members of the scene plugged in the amplifiers for their instruments and PA speakers into the lampposts on 163rd Street and Prospect Avenue and used their live music events to break down racial barriers between African-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Whites and other ethnic groups. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc also played a key role in developing hip hop music. At 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion \"breaks\", mixing this music with his own Jamaican-style \"toasting\" (a style of chanting and boastful talking over a microphone) to rev up the crowd and dancers. Kool Herc is credited as the \"father\" of hip hop for developing the key DJ techniques that, along with rapping, founded the hip hop music style by creating rhythmic beats by looping \"breaks\" (small portions of songs emphasizing a percussive pattern) on two turntables. This was later accompanied by \"rapping\" or \"MCing\" and beatboxing.[citation needed] An original form of dancing called breakdancing, which later became accompanied by popping, locking and other dance styles, which was done to the accompaniment of hip hop songs played on boom boxes and particular fashion styles also developed. ~Wikipedia '),
(7, 'Punk Rock', 'Punk rock (or \"punk\") is a rock music genre that developed in the mid-1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \"proto-punk\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically produced short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through independent record labels and other informal channels.\r\n\r\nThe term \"punk rock\" was first used by certain American rock critics in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and subsequent acts then perceived as stylistic inheritors. Between 1974 and 1976 the movement now bearing the name \"punk rock\" emerged. It produced a new generation of bands such as Television and the Ramones in New York City, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Damned in London, and the Saints in Brisbane—by late-1976 these acts were generally recognized as forming its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk rock became a major and highly controversial cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. It spawned a punk subculture expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive styles of clothing and adornment (ranging from deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, as well as bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies that have since been associated with the form.\r\n\r\nIn 1977 the influence of punk rock music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading throughout various countries worldwide. It generally took root in local scenes that tended to reject affiliation with the mainstream. In the late 1970s punk experienced its second wave in which acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as hardcore punk (e.g. Minor Threat), street punk (e.g. the Exploited), and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk often later pursued other musical directions, resulting in a broad range of spinoffs, giving rise to genres such as post-punk, new wave and later indie pop, alternative rock, and noise rock. By the 1990s punk rock re-emerged in the mainstream, as pop punk bands such as Green Day and the Offspring brought the genre widespread popularity. ~ Wikipedia'),
(8, 'New Wave ', 'New wave is a genre of rock music[2] popular in late 1970s and the 1980s with ties to mid-1970s punk rock.[17] New wave moved away from blues and rock and roll sounds to create pop music that incorporated disco, mod, and electronic music. Initially new wave was similar to punk rock, before becoming a distinct genre. It subsequently engendered subgenres and fusions, including synth-pop.[14]\r\n\r\nNew wave differs from other movements with ties to first-wave punk as it displays characteristics common to pop music, rather than the more \"artsy\" post-punk.[18] Although it incorporates much of the original punk rock sound and ethos,[5][19] new wave exhibits greater complexity in both music and lyrics. Common characteristics of new wave music include the use of synthesizers and electronic productions, the importance of styling and the arts, as well as diversity.[18]\r\n\r\nNew wave has been called one of the definitive genres of the 1980s,[20] after it grew partially fixated on MTV (the Buggles\' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" music video was broadcast as the first music video to promote the channel\'s launch),[18] and the popularity of several new wave artists, attributed to their exposure on the channel. In the mid-1980s, differences between new wave and other music genres began to blur.[21][18] New wave has enjoyed resurgences since the 1990s, after a rising \"nostalgia\" for several new wave-influenced artists. Subsequently, the genre influenced other genres.[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][excessive citations][improper synthesis?] During the 2000s, a number of acts, such as the Strokes, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand and The Killers explored new wave and post-punk influences. These acts were sometimes labeled \"new wave of new wave\". ~Wikipedia'),
(9, 'Heavy Metal ', 'Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music[1] that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom.[2] With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock,[3] the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.[3]\r\n\r\nIn 1968, three of the genre\'s most famous acts, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were founded. Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre\'s evolution by discarding much of its blues influence;[4][5] Motörhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\".\r\n\r\nDuring the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.~Wikipedia'),
(10, 'Grunge ', 'Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock and a subculture that emerged during the mid-1980s in the Pacific Northwest U.S. state of Washington, particularly in Seattle and nearby towns. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle\'s independent record label Sub Pop and that region\'s underground music scene. By the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge bands appearing in California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia, building strong followings and signing major record deals.\r\n\r\nGrunge was commercially successful in the early–mid 1990s, due to releases such as Nirvana\'s Nevermind, Pearl Jam\'s Ten, Soundgarden\'s Superunknown, Alice in Chains\' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots\' Core. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of rock music at the time.[2] Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, they influenced modern rock music, as their lyrics brought socially conscious issues into pop culture[3] and added introspection and an exploration of what it means to be true to oneself.[4] Grunge was also an influence on later genres such as post-grunge (e.g.: Creed and Nickelback) and nu metal (e.g.: Korn and Limp Bizkit).\r\n\r\nGrunge fuses elements of punk rock and heavy metal, such as the distorted electric guitar used in both genres, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. Like these genres, grunge typically uses electric guitar, bass guitar, a drummer and a singer. Grunge also incorporates influences from indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Lyrics are typically angst-filled and introspective, often addressing themes such as social alienation, apathy, concerns about confinement, and a desire for freedom.\r\n\r\nA number of factors contributed to grunge\'s decline in prominence. During the mid-to-late 1990s, many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana\'s Kurt Cobain, labeled by Time as \"the John Lennon of the swinging Northwest\", appeared unusually tortured by success and struggled with an addiction to heroin before he died by suicide at the age of 27 in 1994.'),
(11, 'Ragtime ', 'Ragtime – also spelled rag-time or rag time[1] – is a musical style that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918.[2] Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \"ragged\", rhythm.[2] The style has its origins in African-American communities in cities such as St. Louis.[3][4] Ernest Hogan (1865–1909) was a pioneer of ragtime and was the first composer to have his ragtime pieces (or \"rags\") published as sheet music, beginning with the song \"LA Pas Ma LA,\" published in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term ragtime. The term is actually derived from his hometown \"Shake Rag\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky.[citation needed] Ben Harney, another Kentucky native, has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition, \"You\'ve Been a Good Old Wagon But You Done Broke Down\", helped popularize the style. The composition was published in 1895, a few months after Ernest Hogan\'s \"LA Pas Ma LA.\"[5][6] Ragtime was also a modification of the march style popularized by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music.[7] Ragtime composer Scott Joplin (ca. 1868–1917) became famous through the publication of the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \"The Entertainer\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s.[8][9] For at least 12 years after its publication, \"Maple Leaf Rag\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.[10]\r\n\r\nRagtime fell out of favor as jazz claimed the public\'s imagination after 1917, but there have been numerous revivals since the music has been re-discovered. First in the early 1940s, many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime genres of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded. In 1971 Joshua Rifkin brought out a compilation of Joplin\'s work which was nominated for a Grammy Award.[11] In 1973 The New England Ragtime Ensemble (then a student group called The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble) recorded The Red Back Book, a compilation of some of Joplin\'s rags in period orchestrations edited by conservatory president Gunther Schuller. This also won a Grammy for Best Chamber Music Performance of the year and was named Billboard\'s Top Classical Album of 1974. Subsequently, the motion picture The Sting (1973) brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. The film\'s rendering of \"The Entertainer\", adapted and orchestrated by Marvin Hamlisch, was a Top 5 hit in 1975.~Wikipedia\r\n'),
(12, 'Disco', 'Disco is a musical style originating in the early 1970s. It began to emerge from America\'s urban nightlife scene, where it had been curtailed to house parties and makeshift discotheques from the middle of the decade onwards, after which, it began making regular mainstream appearances, gaining popularity and increasing airplay on radio. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers, both male and female, from the gay, African American, Italian American,[1][2] Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. Several dances styles were also developed during this time including the Bump and the Hustle.\r\n\r\nThe disco sound often has several components, a \"four-on-the-floor\" beat, an eighth note (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, syncopated electric bass line. In most disco tracks, string sections, horns, electric piano, and electric rhythm guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and lead guitar is less frequently used in disco than in rock. Many disco songs use electronic synthesizers, particularly in the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nWell-known 1970s and 1980s disco performers included: Vicki Sue Robinson, Yvonne Elliman, Grace Jones, Divine, Lime, Thelma Houston, Diana Ross, Cher, Cheryl Lynn, Donna Summer, the Bee Gees, Boney M., Claudja Barry, Billy Ocean, Cerrone, Dan Hartman, Madonna, Miquel Brown, Chaka Khan, KC and the Sunshine Band, the Trammps, Marlena Shaw, Sylvester, Village People, Gloria Gaynor, Amii Stewart, and Chic. While performers and singers garnered much public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the \"disco sound\". Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco\'s popularity, and films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Thank God It\'s Friday (1978) contributed to disco\'s rise in mainstream popularity.\r\n\r\nBy the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, where DJs would mix a seamless sequence of dance records. Studio 54, a venue popular among celebrities, was a well-known disco club of that time. Discotheque-goers often wore expensive, extravagant and sexy fashions. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine and Quaaludes, a drug that was so common in disco subculture that it was nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". ~Wikipedia'),
(13, 'Techno ', 'Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s.[2][3][4][5] The first recorded use of the word techno in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988.[6][7] Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built.[8]\r\n\r\nIn Detroit, techno resulted from the melding of African American music including Chicago house, funk, electro, and electric jazz with electronic music by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder, and Yellow Magic Orchestra.[9] Added to this is the influence of futuristic and fictional themes[10] relevant to life in American late capitalist society, with Alvin Toffler\'s book The Third Wave being a notable point of reference.[11][12] Pioneering producer Juan Atkins cites Toffler\'s phrase \"techno rebels\" as inspiring him to use the word techno to describe the musical style he helped to create. This unique blend of influences aligns techno with the aesthetic referred to as afrofuturism. To producers such as Derrick May, the transference of spirit from the body to the machine is often a central preoccupation; essentially an expression of technological spirituality.[13][14] In this manner: \"techno dance music defeats what Adorno saw as the alienating effect of mechanisation on the modern consciousness\".[15]\r\n\r\nStylistically, techno is generally repetitive instrumental music, often produced for use in a continuous DJ set. The central rhythmic component is most often in common time (4/4), where time is marked with a bass drum on each quarter note pulse, a backbeat played by snare or clap on the second and fourth pulses of the bar, and an open hi-hat sounding every second eighth note. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 to 150 beats per minute (bpm), depending on the style of techno. The creative use of music production technology, such as drum machines, synthesizers, and digital audio workstations, is viewed as an important aspect of the music\'s aesthetic. Many producers use retro electronic musical devices to create what they consider to be an authentic techno sound. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland\'s TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro technology are popular among techno producers.\r\n\r\nMusic journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term; so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.'),
(14, 'Experimental Rock ', 'Experimental rock (or avant-rock) is a subgenre of rock music[2] which pushes the boundaries of common composition and performance technique[11] or which experiments with the basic elements of the genre.[12] Artists aim to liberate and innovate, with some of the genre\'s distinguishing characteristics being improvisational performances, avant-garde influences, odd instrumentation, opaque lyrics (or instrumentals), unorthodox structures and rhythms, and an underlying rejection of commercial aspirations.[3]\r\n\r\nFrom its inception, rock music was experimental, but it wasn\'t until the late 1960s that rock artists began creating extended and complex compositions through advancements in multitrack recording. In 1967, the genre was as commercially viable as pop music, but by 1970, most of its leading players had incapacitated themselves in some form. In Germany, the krautrock subgenre merged elements of improvisation and psychedelic rock with avant-garde and contemporary classical pieces. Later in the 1970s, significant musical crossbreeding took place in tandem with the developments of punk and new wave, DIY experimentation, and electronic music. Funk, jazz-rock, and fusion rhythms also became integrated into experimental rock music.\r\n\r\nThe first wave of 1980s experimental rock groups had few direct precedents for their sound. Later in the decade, avant-rock pursued a psychedelic aesthetic that differed from the self-consciousness and vigilance of earlier post-punk. During the 1990s, a loose movement known as post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock. As of the 2010s, the term \"experimental rock\" has fallen to indiscriminate use, with many modern rock bands being categorized under prefixes such as \"post-\", \"kraut-\", \"psych-\", and \"noise-\". ~ Wikipedia'),
(15, 'Grindcore', 'Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.\r\n\r\nA trait of grindcore is the \"microsong\". Several bands have produced songs that are only seconds in length.[1] British band Napalm Death holds the Guinness World Record for shortest song ever recorded with the one-second \"You Suffer\" (1987). Many bands, such as Agoraphobic Nosebleed, record simple phrases that may be rhythmically sprawled out across an instrumental lasting only a couple of bars in length.\r\n\r\nA variety of microgenres have subsequently emerged, often labeling bands according to traits that deviate from regular grindcore, including goregrind, focused on themes of gore (e.g. mutilation and pathology), and pornogrind, fixated on pornographic lyrical themes. Another offshoot is electrogrind (or cybergrind) which incorporates electronic music elements such as sampling and programmed drums. Although influential within hardcore and extreme metal, grindcore remains an underground form of music.'),
(16, 'Hardcore Punk ', 'Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre and subculture that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock.[8] Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time. It was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk.[7] New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\"[9] and often addresses social and political topics with \"confrontational, politically-charged lyrics\".[10]\r\n\r\nHardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in Washington, D.C., New York, New Jersey, and Boston—as well as in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Hardcore has spawned the straight edge movement and its associated submovements, hardline and youth crew. Hardcore was heavily involved in the rise of the independent record labels in the 1980s and with the DIY ethics in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including alternative rock, thrash metal, emo and metalcore.\r\n\r\nWhile traditional hardcore has never experienced mainstream commercial success, some of its early pioneers have garnered appreciation over time. Black Flag\'s Damaged, Minutemen\'s Double Nickels on the Dime and Hüsker Dü\'s New Day Rising were included in Rolling Stone\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003 and Dead Kennedys have seen one of their albums reach gold status over a period of 25 years.[11] In 2011, Rolling Stone writer David Fricke placed Greg Ginn of Black Flag 99th place in his 100 Greatest Guitarists list. Although the music genre started in English-speaking western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in Italy, Brazil, Japan, Europe and the Middle East.'),
(17, 'Crust Punk', 'Crust punk (also known as crustcore or simply crust) is a form of music influenced by English punk rock and extreme metal.[3] The style, which evolved in the mid-1980s in England, often has songs with dark and pessimistic lyrics that linger on political and social ills. The term \"crust\" was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 Ripper Crust demo.[4]\r\n\r\nCrust is partly defined by its \"bassy\" and \"dirty\" sound. It is often played at a fast tempo with occasional slow sections. Vocals are usually guttural and may be grunted, growled or screamed. Crust punk takes cues from the anarcho-punk of Crass and Discharge[3] and the extreme metal of bands like Venom, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost and Motörhead.[3][5] While the term was first associated with Hellbastard, Amebix have been described as the originators of the style, along with Discharge and Antisect.');
