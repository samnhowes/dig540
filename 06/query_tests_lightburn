With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style. Upon release, it received a mixed response, due to the album\'s unconventional style and experimental sound, but became Davis\'s first gold record;[6] it sold more than half a million copies.'),

Most of the previous 100-plus albums that have graced these pages were created by bands that had a solid core and had been playing together (if not recording together) for years. Cause for Alarm was the second album from a band in transition at the time. Two of the five members who played on it weren�t on the band�s 1984 debut, Victim in Pain, and this is, in fact, the only Agnostic Front album they ever played on. Further adding to the intrigue is the involvement of Peter Steele (R.I.P.), who was fronting Carnivore at the time, but also had a hand in helping to create this album.\r\nDespite the less than solid lineup and other circumstances surrounding the making of the record, the quintet responsible for Cause�vocalist Roger Miret, guitarists Vinnie Stigma and Alex Kinon, bassist Rob Kabula and drummer Louie Beato�stepped up and made a crossover album that would piss off skinheads with its thrash-influenced music, outrage P.C. talk show hosts with its controversial lyrics and win over a rabid metal contingent with its streetwise hardcore intensity. This is an album that predates the Cro-Mags� The Age of Quarrel by about four months, and it presaged a significant shift in one of the country�s most entrenched punk scenes.\r\n~Decibal '),

After Hit Parader editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted Danny Fields, insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.\r\n\r\nThe album cover, photographed by Punk magazine\'s Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album\'s liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart.

It was the first album that Waits produced himself. Stylistically different from his previous LPs, the album moves away from the piano and string orchestra arrangements of the late 1970s, replacing them instead with unusual instrumentation and a somewhat more abstract songwriting approach.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe cover art is a TinTone photograph by Michael A. Russ showing Waits with the actors Angelo Rossitto and Lee Kolima.\r\n\r\nThe album peaked at #164 on the Billboard Pop Albums and 200 albums charts. In 1989, Spin named Swordfishtrombones the second greatest album of all time.

(18, 12, 'The Rise of the Serpent Men ', 22, 17, 1989, 'Graphic Illustration ', 'The lyrical theme of Rise of the Serpent Men is mainly anti-war, anti-religious and the environment. No surprises there, but they are very well written and like most crust and metal bands they use metaphors and go a lot deeper than standard black and white punk lyrics. Lyrically, my favorite on this album would have to be Life Chain. I view Life Chain with two different meanings. One interpretation is saying that people are strong enough to break away from the chains of religion they just need to realize it. Religion constantly tells people that they are weak, they�re sinners and that they need a magical being to get them through life. Axegrinder believes that that is bullshit and that people need to take control. The other interpretation is that people work themselves to death. Human beings are never satisfied so we work until we die so that we can accumulate more stuff. We create our own slavery with our greed.\r\n\r\nAxegrinder managed to release one of the greatest crust albums in their short existence and earn themselves a spot at the top of the heap. If you dig Amebix, Deviated Instinct, or Hellbastard you�ll love the even more metallic sounding Rise of the Serpent Men. ~Metal Archive'),
(19, 19, 'Bone Machine', 21, 14, 1992, 'Photography', 'Bone Machine is an album by Tom Waits, released in 1992 on Island Records. It won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and features guest appearances by Los Lobos\' David Hidalgo, Primus\' Les Claypool and Brain, and The Rolling Stones\' Keith Richards.\r\n\r\nBone Machine marked a return to studio material for Waits, coming a full five years after his previous studio album, Franks Wild Years (1987). The album is often noted for its dark lyrical themes of death and murder, and for its rough, stripped-down, percussion-heavy blues rock style.\r\n\r\nBone Machine was included on many Best Albums of the 1990s lists, including Pitchfork where it was number 49, and Rolling Stone where it was number 53.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cover photo, which consists of a blurred black-and-white, close-up image of Waits in a leather skullcap with horns and protective goggles, was taken by Jesse Dylan, the son of Bob Dylan. He wears this same outfit in the video for \"Goin\' Out West\" and \"I Don\'t Wanna Grow up\". ~Wikipedia');

(17, 18, 'Swordfishtrombones', 21, 2, 1983, 'Colored Tin Type, Photography ', 'Swordfishtrombones is an album by American singer-songwriter Tom Waits, released in September 1983. It was the first album that Waits produced himself. Stylistically different from his previous LPs, the album moves away from the piano and string orchestra arrangements of the late 1970s, replacing them instead with unusual instrumentation and a somewhat more abstract songwriting approach.[citation needed]\r\n\r\nThe cover art is a TinTone photograph by Michael A. Russ showing Waits with the actors Angelo Rossitto and Lee Kolima.\r\n\r\nThe album peaked at #164 on the Billboard Pop Albums and 200 albums charts. In 1989, Spin named Swordfishtrombones the second greatest album of all time. In 2006, Q placed the album at #36 in its list of \"40 Best Albums of the \'80s.\" Pitchfork listed Swordfishtrombones as 11th best album of the 1980s. Slant Magazine listed the album at #26 on its list of \"Best Albums of the 1980\'s\". ~Wikipedia'),
(18, 12, 'The Rise of the Serpent Men ', 22, 17, 1989, 'Graphic Illustration ', 'The lyrical theme of Rise of the Serpent Men is mainly anti-war, anti-religious and the environment. No surprises there, but they are very well written and like most crust and metal bands they use metaphors and go a lot deeper than standard black and white punk lyrics. Lyrically, my favorite on this album would have to be Life Chain. I view Life Chain with two different meanings. One interpretation is saying that people are strong enough to break away from the chains of religion they just need to realize it. Religion constantly tells people that they are weak, they’re sinners and that they need a magical being to get them through life. Axegrinder believes that that is bullshit and that people need to take control. The other interpretation is that people work themselves to death. Human beings are never satisfied so we work until we die so that we can accumulate more stuff. We create our own slavery with our greed.\r\n\r\nAxegrinder managed to release one of the greatest crust albums in their short existence and earn themselves a spot at the top of the heap. If you dig Amebix, Deviated Instinct, or Hellbastard you’ll love the even more metallic sounding Rise of the Serpent Men. ~Metal Archive'),
(19, 19, 'Bone Machine', 21, 14, 1992, 'Photography', 'Bone Machine is an album by Tom Waits, released in 1992 on Island Records. It won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, and features guest appearances by Los Lobos\' David Hidalgo, Primus\' Les Claypool and Brain, and The Rolling Stones\' Keith Richards.\r\n\r\nBone Machine marked a return to studio material for Waits, coming a full five years after his previous studio album, Franks Wild Years (1987). The album is often noted for its dark lyrical themes of death and murder, and for its rough, stripped-down, percussion-heavy blues rock style.\r\n\r\nBone Machine was included on many Best Albums of the 1990s lists, including Pitchfork where it was number 49, and Rolling Stone where it was number 53.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cover photo, which consists of a blurred black-and-white, close-up image of Waits in a leather skullcap with horns and protective goggles, was taken by Jesse Dylan, the son of Bob Dylan.

After Taylor left the band, Ronnie Wood took his place in 1975 and has been on guitar in tandem with Richards ever since. Following Wyman\'s departure in 1993, Darryl Jones joined as their touring bassist. Touring keyboardists for the band have been Nicky Hopkins (1967–1982), Ian McLagan (1978–1981), Billy Preston (through the mid-1970s) and Chuck Leavell (1982–present).

(9, 'Led Zeppelin', 'Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band\'s heavy, guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including blues, psychedelia, and folk music.', 1969),
(10, 'Funkadelic ', 'Funkadelic is an American band that was most prominent during the 1970s. The band and its sister act Parliament, both led by George Clinton, pioneered the funk music culture of that decade.\r\nThe group that would become Funkadelic was originally formed by George Clinton in 1964, as the unnamed musical backing for his doo wop group The Parliaments while on tour. The band originally consisted of musicians Frankie Boyce, Richard Boyce, and Langston Booth plus the five members of the Parliaments on vocals. Boyce, Boyce, and Booth enlisted in the Army in 1966, and Clinton recruited bassist Billy Bass Nelson and guitarist Eddie Hazel in 1967, then also added guitarist Tawl Ross and drummer Tiki Fulwood. The band name \"Funkadelic\" was coined by Nelson after the band relocated to Detroit. By 1968, because of a dispute with Revilot, the record company that owned the name \"The Parliaments,\" the ensemble began playing under the name Funkadelic.', 1970),
(11, 'Johnny Cash ', 'John R. Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He is widely considered one of the most influential popular musicians of the 20th century and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide.Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame.\r\n\r\nCash was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice,the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band, which is characterized by train-sound guitar rhythms; a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark, all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black.\" He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, \"Hello, I\'m Johnny Cash,\"followed by his signature song \"Folsom Prison Blues\".', 1957),
(12, 'Easy E', 'Eric Lynn Wright (September 7, 1964 – March 26, 1995), better known by his stage name Eazy-E, was an American rapper who performed solo and in the hip hop group N.W.A.

After dropping out of high school in the tenth grade, he supported himself primarily by selling drugs before founding Ruthless Records and becoming a rapper. Arabian Prince, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Ice Cube formed N.W.A. After DJ Yella and MC Ren joined the group, N.W.A released their debut single Panic Zone. In 1988, they released their most controversial album, Straight Outta Compton. The group released two more albums and then disbanded after Eazy released Dr. Dre from his contract. Eazy-E died in March 1995 after a brief battle with AIDS.\r\n\r\nEazy\'s main influences included 1970s funk groups, contemporary rappers, and comedians. When reviewing Eazy\'s albums, many critics noted his unique overall style, with Steve Huey of the All Music Guide remarking: \"While his technical skills as a rapper were never the greatest, his distinctive delivery... over-the-top lyrics, and undeniable charisma made him a star.\"~ Wikipedia', 1988),

For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, lead vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky \"Topper\" Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones\' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\r\n\r\nThe Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their self-titled debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone.

They toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album Licensed to Ill.

Simone employed a broad range of musical styles including classical, jazz, blues, folk, R&B, gospel, and pop.\r\n\r\nBorn in North Carolina, the sixth child of a preacher, Waymon aspired to be a concert pianist.[1] With the help of a few supporters in her hometown of Tryon, North Carolina, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York.[2]\r\n\r\nWaymon then applied for a scholarship to study at the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she was denied admission despite a well-received audition.[3] Waymon became fully convinced this rejection had been entirely due to racial discrimination. Years later, two days before her death, the Curtis Institute of Music bestowed on her an honorary degree.[3]\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Eunice Waymon changed her name to \"Nina Simone\". The change related to her need to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil\'s music\"[3] or \"cocktail piano\" at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, and this effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.[4]\r\n\r\nSimone recorded more than 40 albums, mostly between 1958, when she made her debut with Little Girl Blue, and 1974. She had a hit in the United States in 1958 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\".[1]\r\n\r\nSimone\'s musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach,[5] and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.[6][7] In 2018, Simone will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[8 ~Wikipedia', 1958),
(16, 'Napalm Death ', 'Napalm Death are a British extreme metal band formed in Meriden, West Midlands, England, in 1981.[1] While none of its original members remain in the group since December 1986, the lineup of vocalist Mark \"Barney\" Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent of the band\'s career since 1992\'s Utopia Banished, although, from 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added Jesse Pintado as the replacement of one-time guitarist Bill Steer; following Pintado\'s departure, the band reverted to a four-piece rather than replace him.\r\n\r\nNapalm Death are credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of crust punk and death metal, using a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdrive bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of incomprehensible growls, or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, fast tempos, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band\'s debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community.[2] According to the Guinness World Records, their song \"You Suffer\" is the shortest song in the world, at only 1.316 seconds long.\r\n\r\nNapalm Death have released fifteen studio albums and are listed by Nielsen SoundScan as the seventh best-selling death metal band in the United States.[3] ~Wikipedia ', 1981),

After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag reunited in 2003 and again in 2013.[1]\r\n\r\nBlack Flag\'s sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and, in later years, frequent tempo shifts. The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and nonconformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia. These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981. Most of the band\'s material was released on Ginn\'s independent record label SST Records.', 1981),

They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years.[2] In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded.[3] By 2014, all four of the band\'s original members, lead singer Joey Ramone (1951–2001), bass guitarist Dee Dee Ramone (1951–2002), guitarist Johnny Ramone (1948–2004) and drummer Tommy Ramone (1949–2014), had died.[4][5][6][7]\r\n\r\nRecognition of the band\'s importance built over the years, and they are now mentioned in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as number 26 in the Rolling Stone magazine list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\"[8] and number 17 in VH1\'s \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\".[9] In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only the Beatles.[10] On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommy\'s replacement on drums, Marky Ramone, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[2][11] In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.', 1976),
(21, 'Tom Waits ', 'Thomas Alan Waits (born December 7, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, composer and actor. His distinctive voice was described by critic Daniel Durchholz as sounding as though \"it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car\".[1] Waits has built up a distinctive musical persona with his trademark growl, his incorporation of pre-rock music styles such as blues,[2][3][4] jazz, and vaudeville, and experimental tendencies verging on industrial music.[5]\r\n\r\nBorn to a middle-class Euro-American family, Waits was raised in Whittier, California, and then San Diego. Inspired by Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, as a teenager he began singing on the San Diego folk music scene. Relocating to Los Angeles, he secured work as a songwriter before gaining a recording contract with Asylum Records and producing his first album, Closing Time, in 1973.
